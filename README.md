# GoLocal (API): Having the quality of a Farmer's Market arrive at your doorstep!

This application allows the user to experience an E-commerce by shopping for general groceries and produces they can find at a typical farmer's market. The user is able to add specific produce into their shopping cart and remove if needed. They'll be able to go through a checkout process that is fully functional through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to accept all credit/debit card payment methods.

As a team we decided to move forward with this theme as we all had an appreciation for the freshness and healthy options that farmer's markets can offer. We then began to wish that there was an application that offered this experience rather than going to one in person. Which is when we decided to move forward with building GoLocal!

## Planning Story

We initially planned to make this app into an E-commerce where Produce owners and shoppers can both add and purchase amongst each other in a simplified-fashion as a community while logged into their accounts.

The team would collaborate amongst each other to work through any differences in coding or merge conflicts positively through the Scrum framework.
